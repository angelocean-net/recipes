		<p>Pot pies are a staple of midwestern American food culture. They are perfectly reflective of the diverse togetherness of the dinner table, where people and ingredients of all kinds come together to share in one precious meal. Just like with our households, no two pot pies look the same: these treasure chests of flavor come in all different shapes and sizes.</p>
		<p>However, I like to keep things simple, classic. So, if you're like me and want to just stick to the basics, or you're just looking for a place to start building off into your own culinary self-expression, this amazing chicken pot pie recipe will be great for you!</p>
