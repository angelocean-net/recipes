		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>1 Tbsp baking powder</li>
			<li>1 tsp salt</li>
			<li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup cold butter <sub>thinly sliced</sub></li>
			<li>1 cup cold buttermilk</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Instructions:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat oven to 425&deg;F</li>
			<li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt</li>
			<li>Add butter and cut in with a pastry blender until pea-size clumps form</li>
			<li>Create a well in the center of the mixture by pushing the mixture toward the sides of the bowl. Pour buttermilk into the well. Mix gently with a fork until <em>just</em> combined (over mixing will make tough biscuits!)</li>
			<li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and create a rectangle using your hands</li>
			<li>Fold the dough into thirds (like folding a letter: fold left side over center, then right side, so it's still in a rectangular shape). Then, roll back out to 1&quot; thick. Repeat the folding and rolling process twice more, rolling the dough out to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&quot; thick the final time</li>
			<li>Cut out about 12 biscuits with a 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&quot;-3&quot; cutter. Re-roll any scraps until there's about 10-12 biscuits</li>
			<li>Transfer biscuits to a baking sheet so that the biscuits are touching each other and the edge</li>
			<li>Bake at 425&deg; for about 13-15 minutes until cooked through and golden brown on top</li>
		</ol>
